### Module: Netmiko Introdution

[item]: # (/slide)



While having proper API access to a device is important, the reality is that a lot of legacy networking gear
will not have this capability.  That shouldn't stop us from thinking about operating infrastructure in a
programmatic way.  We can use the [netmiko library](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko) to automate tasks that
are normally accomplished via ssh.

The purpose of this repository is to provide an introduction to using this library, based largely upon
[this tutorial](https://pynet.twb-tech.com/blog/automation/netmiko.html)

All credit/props to Kirk Byers (@ktbyers) for his great work on this library

#### About Netmiko

* open-source Python library that simplifies SSH management to network devices
* based on the Paramiko SSH library

#### Provides the following capabilities
* establish an SSH connection to the device
* Simplify the execution of show commands and the retrieval of output data
* Simplify execution of configuration commands including possibly commit actions
* Do the above across a broad set of networking vendors and platforms
